Note, all R code is (at least should be) written so that it will access the files in this folder. Basically, if you move the .csv/.xlsx files around it will break the code, though all you will have to do to fix the code is to change where the code looks for the files. 


formattedR - site and pedon data formatted as .csv for input to R (see ExcelToR.R). 

Rosetta: Files associated with running the Rosetta (soil:water) model on the both april's and the USGS horizon level data.


BeefBasin_AllPedons_edit.xlsx - edited USGS pedon data in excel format edited to included depth to root restricting layer, if a root restricing layer was reached, and with all MaxCarbStage data entered.
